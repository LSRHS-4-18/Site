  <h1>citizenship</h1>
<p>citizenship is being a good citizen</p>

<p>it is not important because you don't have to stand up for people or be brave to be a good person</p>
<p>respect is honoring or admirering people</p>
<p>it is imoprtant because people know that you will respect them</p>
<p>compassion is careing for others</p>
<p> it is important because if you don't care about others people won't want to be aroud you</p>
<p>honesty is telling the truth and never stealing</p>
<p>it is important because people need to trust that you will tell the truth</p>
<p>responsibility is being responsible for your actions</p>
